TODO: Write unit tests with `unittest` python package

### Functionality
 * TODO --> Setup milestones on Github/issue trackers
 * We should aim to implement MVC architecture

### Development Stack & Workflow
* I'm using Anaconda as my package manager
    * see their website for installation 
    * can install flask with anaconda by doing the following:
    ```conda install flask```
* Only bug-free version of the app will go in the master branch
    * Branch off of ``development`` to add features and merge back into it
    (don't merge into master directly)
* I'm using PyCharm if anyone is in need of a good Python
IDE
* Uses MongoDB hosted on Azure
    
## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* Flask-based web service
* `python -m pip install pymongo`
* `conda install dnspython`


### Documentation
* See [Google's Style Guide (only worried about docstrings)](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)

* We can generate html software documentation using Sphinx if we follow a specific format like google's

  * not sure about ^ this yet. might not be worth it if we just use markdown

## Usage

### Running the app locally
If you want to run the app locally using the development
server, just run `python news_api.py` and as long as you 
have Python and Flask correctly installed, it should work.
